This is the DrugBank dataset for the paper "HDN-DDI: a novel framework for predicting drug-drug interactions using hierarchical molecular graphs and enhanced dual-view representation learning" (Paper | [Code](https://github.com/jcsun-00/HDN-DDI.git))

The DrugBank dataset was proposed by [Wishart et al](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkx1037). and has been iterated in multiple versions. The full dataset can be found [here](https://go.drugbank.com/).

The version used in the HDN-DDI paper is the same as that used in the [BDN-DDI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107340), [DSN-DDI](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbac597) and other papers. Specifically, the DrugBank used by DDI prediction methods is comprises 1,706 drugs with 86 types of interactions, yielding 191,808 positive DDI instances.
